I am a passionate Software Developer with 2+ years of experience in building applications using Python and JavaScript.

I have a computer science background, extremely enthusiastic about Software/Web Development, Cloud Computing, Data Science and Data Visualization. One of my biggest hobbies is to build different side projects to try new technologies and solve real-world problems.

Recent graduate of the Memorial University with a GPA of 3.75 and Iâ€™m currently looking for a full-time job in Software Development.
