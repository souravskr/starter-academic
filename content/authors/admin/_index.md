I own almost 2+ years of software development experience with Python with a LinkedIn Skill Assessment badge, JavaScript and version control system.

Being an open-minded individual, I always like to cope with new challenges, take on new opportunities, learn new skills. I am interested in Software/Web Development, Cloud Computing, Data Science and Data Visualization. Turn my ideas to solve real-world problems into a reality is one of my favourite hobbies.

Recent graduate from Memorial University and currently looking for a full-time job in Software Development.
